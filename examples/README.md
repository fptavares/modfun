# mod:o:fun examples

## Modes
A simple user service that shows how to build the same application using both modes:
* [User service in function mode](https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun/tree/master/examples/function-mode)
* [User service in req/res mode](https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun/tree/master/examples/reqres-mode)

More examples will be added in the coming weeks.

## Real world

Thereâ€™s also a [real-world example](https://github.com/fptavares/record-scrobbler) that includes:
* [A GraphQL endpoint deployed on Google Cloud Functions](https://github.com/fptavares/record-scrobbler/tree/master/web-api)
* [An AWS Lambda deployment using the default function mode](https://github.com/fptavares/record-scrobbler/tree/master/discogs-service)
* [A Google Cloud Functions deployment using the request/response mode](https://github.com/fptavares/record-scrobbler/tree/master/lastfm-service)

All using modofun, combined with Babel and other cool technology.
