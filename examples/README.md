# Examples

## User service &ndash; in two modes

A simple user service that shows how to build the same application using both modes:
* [User service in function mode](https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun/tree/master/examples/user-function-mode)
* [User service in request/response mode](https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun/tree/master/examples/user-reqres-mode)

This example includes middleware to require authentication on certain requests, using JWT tokens. It also uses an Express server to mimic a serverless execution environment locally without having to install an emulator. Try it out:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun.git

cd modofun/examples/user-function-mode
npm install
npm start

curl -d '{"credentials": "X"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:3000/authenticate
```

## To-Do service &ndash; running on Google Cloud Functions

[An example To-Do service](https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun/tree/master/examples/todo-google-cloud-functions) that includes scripts to run on Google Cloud Functions, or in the emulator. Install it like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun.git

cd modofun/examples/todo-google-cloud-functions
npm install
```

To try it out on Google Cloud, first [follow Google's instructions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart) to enable the Cloud Functions API, and install the SDK and components.

Create a stage bucket on Cloud Storage. For the script to work without changes, use the bucket name: _modofun-example-src_.

```bash
gsutil mb -p [PROJECT_ID] gs://modofun-example-src
```

Afterwards, when you're ready to deploy the function, use the deploy script:

```bash
npm run deploy

curl https://us-central1-[PROJECT_ID].cloudfunctions.net/myModofunExample/addTodo/joe?todo=Do+the+dishes
curl https://us-central1-[PROJECT_ID].cloudfunctions.net/myModofunExample/getTodos/joe
```

Or try it out using the [local emulator for Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/emulator):

```bash
npm run start-emulator
npm run deploy-to-emulator

curl http://localhost:8010/[PROJECT_ID]/us-central1/myModofunExample/addTodo/joe?todo=Do+the+dishes
curl http://localhost:8010/[PROJECT_ID]/us-central1/myModofunExample/getTodos/joe

npm run stop-emulator
```

## To-Do service &ndash; running on AWS Lambda

[An example To-Do service](https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun/tree/master/examples/todo-aws-lambda) that includes scripts to deploy it to AWS Lambda using CloudFormation, or in the AWS Lambda emulator. Install it like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun.git

cd modofun/examples/todo-aws-lambda
npm install
```

To try it out on AWS, first [follow AWS's instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/setup.html) to set up your account, and install the AWS CLI (Command Line Interface).

Create an S3 bucket to host the code:

```bash
npm run create-s3-bucket
```

Afterwards, when you're ready to deploy the function, use the deploy script, which will package it and deploy it using CloudFormation:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

After the deployment is complete, it looks up the base URL for the newly deployed API from the AWS CloudFormation Stack. You should see it printed at the end of the console logs when the deployment scripts are finished. It should look like this: `https://[api-id].execute-api.[aws-region].amazonaws.com/Prod/`.

```bash
curl https://[api-id].execute-api.[aws-region].amazonaws.com/Prod/addTodo/joe?todo=Do+the+dishes
curl https://[api-id].execute-api.[aws-region].amazonaws.com/Prod/myModofunExample/getTodos/joe
```

You can also try it out using the [local emulator for AWS Lambda](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/test-sam-local.html):

```bash
npm run start-local

curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/addTodo/joe?todo=Do+the+dishes
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/getTodos/joe
```

*But note* that there's currently [a bug in the AWS local emulator](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local/issues/65) that prevents greedy path variable from working properly.

## Real-world application

Thereâ€™s also a [real-world example](https://github.com/fptavares/record-scrobbler) that includes:
* [A GraphQL endpoint deployed on Google Cloud Functions](https://github.com/fptavares/record-scrobbler/tree/master/web-api)
* [An AWS Lambda deployment using the default function mode](https://github.com/fptavares/record-scrobbler/tree/master/discogs-service)
* [A Google Cloud Functions deployment using the request/response mode](https://github.com/fptavares/record-scrobbler/tree/master/lastfm-service)

All using modofun, combined with Gulp, Babel and other cool technology.
