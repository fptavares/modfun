# mod:o:fun examples

A simple user service that shows how to build the same application using both modes:
* [User service in function mode](https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun/tree/master/examples/function-mode)
* [User service in req/res mode](https://github.com/modofunjs/modofun/tree/master/examples/reqres-mode)

More examples will be added in the coming weeks.
